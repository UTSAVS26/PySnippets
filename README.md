## üëä Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository or contributing.
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the package and snippets.
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for installing the **PySnippets** package.

### Installation

To install **PySnippets** as a Python package, follow these steps:

1. Install the package via pip (assuming the package is published on PyPI):
   ```bash
   pip install pysnippets
   ```

   If the package is still under development, you can install it directly from the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/UTSAVS26/PySnippets.git
   ```

2. Once installed, you can import and use snippets in your Python projects.

### Usage

After installing the package, you can start using the snippets in your project:

```python
# Example: Using a string manipulation snippet
from pysnippets.strings import reverse_string

reversed_str = reverse_string("hello")
print(reversed_str)  # Output: 'olleh'
```

Explore other categories and snippets, such as file handling, math utilities, and more, by navigating the package‚Äôs modules.

### Example Snippets

- **String Manipulation**: Functions like `reverse_string`, `capitalize_first`, etc.
- **File Handling**: Utilities for reading, writing, and managing files.
- **Data Structures**: Custom implementations of common data structures.

Check the full documentation for details on each snippet's functionality and usage examples.
