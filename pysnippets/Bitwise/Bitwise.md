## Introduction

Bitwise operations are a set of operations that directly manipulate bits, the most basic units of data in computing. These operations are integral to various domains, including systems programming, cryptography, error detection, and optimization algorithms. This repository provides Python implementations of essential bitwise operations, each optimized for efficiency and clarity.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand bitwise concepts or an experienced developer seeking optimized solutions for performance-critical applications, this collection serves as a valuable resource.

## Why Bitwise Operations?

Bitwise operations offer several advantages:

- **Performance**: Bitwise operations are generally faster than their arithmetic counterparts because they operate directly on the binary representation of data.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Manipulating data at the bit level can lead to significant memory savings, especially in applications dealing with large datasets or constrained environments.
- **Low-Level Control**: Bitwise operations provide fine-grained control over data, enabling tasks like flag manipulation, mask creation, and bit packing.

Understanding and leveraging bitwise operations can lead to more efficient and optimized code, particularly in scenarios where performance and resource utilization are critical.

## Overview of Code Snippets

### 1. Count Set Bits (`count_set_bits.py`)

**Description**: Counts the number of set bits (`1`s) in the binary representation of an integer.

**Use Case**: Useful in scenarios like calculating parity, determining the number of active flags in a bitmask, or analyzing binary data.

**Implementation Insight**:
- **Approach 1**: Iterates through each bit using bitwise AND and right shift operations.
- **Approach 2**: Utilizes Brian Kernighan’s algorithm, which repeatedly flips the least significant set bit until the number becomes zero, counting the iterations.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from count_bits import count_set_bits

print(count_set_bits(29))  # Output: 4
```

### 2. Find Unique Number (`find_unique.py`)

**Description**: Identifies the unique number in an array where every other number appears exactly twice.

**Use Case**: Commonly used in algorithms dealing with data streams, duplicate elimination, and finding singular elements in datasets.

**Implementation Insight**:
- Leverages the XOR operation, which cancels out duplicate numbers, leaving behind the unique number.
- Efficiently handles large datasets with linear time complexity and constant space.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from find_unique import find_unique

print(find_unique([1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 3
```

### 3. Swap Numbers Without Temporary Variable (`swap.py`)

**Description**: Swaps two integers using bitwise XOR operations without the need for a temporary variable.

**Use Case**: Demonstrates an in-place swapping technique, useful in memory-constrained environments or when optimizing for performance.

**Implementation Insight**:
- Utilizes the properties of XOR to toggle bits and achieve swapping without additional memory overhead.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from swap import swap_numbers

a, b = swap_numbers(5, 7)
print(a, b)  # Output: 7 5
```

### 4. Check Power of Two (`power.py`)

**Description**: Determines whether a given integer is a power of two.

**Use Case**: Applicable in optimizing algorithms that rely on power-of-two constraints, such as certain memory allocation strategies or algorithms that require binary tree optimizations.

**Implementation Insight**:
- Checks if only a single bit is set in the integer's binary form, a hallmark of powers of two.
- Employs the bitwise AND operation between the number and its predecessor.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from power import is_power_of_two

print(is_power_of_two(8))   # Output: True
print(is_power_of_two(10))  # Output: False
```

### 5. Flip Bit (`flip_bit.py`)

**Description**: Flips the bit at a specified position in an integer.

**Use Case**: Useful in scenarios where individual bits represent flags or options that need toggling, such as permission settings or feature flags.

**Implementation Insight**:
- Utilizes bitwise XOR with a mask to invert the targeted bit.
- Ensures that only the specified bit is affected without altering others.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from flip_bit import flip_bit

print(flip_bit(5, 0))  # Output: 4
print(flip_bit(5, 2))  # Output: 1
```

### 6. Clear Least Significant Bits Up To Position (`clear_lsb_upto_n.py`)

**Description**: Clears all least significant bits up to a specified position in an integer.

**Use Case**: Helps in operations such as masking out lower bits for alignment, preparing data for certain algorithms, or extracting higher-order bits.

**Implementation Insight**:
- Applies a bitmask that zeros out the desired bit range using bitwise AND and NOT operations.
- Efficiently isolates the higher-order bits by shifting and masking.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from clear_lsb_upto_n import clear_lsb_up_to_pos

print(clear_lsb_up_to_pos(15, 2))  # Output: 12
print(clear_lsb_up_to_pos(29, 3))  # Output: 24
```

### 7. Isolate Rightmost One Bit (`isolate_right_one.py`)

**Description**: Isolates the rightmost set bit (`1`) in an integer.

**Use Case**: Useful in algorithms that need to process or analyze individual bits, such as in error detection, cryptography, and bitmasking techniques.

**Implementation Insight**:
- Employs two's complement to efficiently isolate the target bit.
- The expression `n & -n` isolates the lowest set bit in constant time.

**Example Usage**:
```python
from isolate_right_one import isolate_rightmost_one

print(isolate_rightmost_one(12))  # Output: 4
print(isolate_rightmost_one(18))  # Output: 2
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Bit Manipulation Techniques

Understanding bit manipulation techniques is crucial for optimizing code that requires low-level data processing. Here are some advanced strategies employed in the snippets:

- **Bit Masking**: Creating masks to isolate, set, or clear specific bits.
- **Bit Shifting**: Efficiently multiplying or dividing numbers by powers of two.
- **Two’s Complement**: A method for representing negative numbers, facilitating operations like bit isolation.
- **Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm**: An efficient way to count set bits by iterating only through the set bits.

### Performance Considerations

Bitwise operations are inherently low-level and generally execute faster than their arithmetic equivalents. However, Python abstracts away many hardware-level optimizations. Despite this, using bitwise operations in Python can still lead to performance improvements, especially in large-scale data processing or when combined with other optimizations such as memoization or parallel processing.

**Benchmarking Tips**:
- Utilize Python’s `timeit` module to benchmark different implementations.
- Compare bitwise approaches against alternative methods to assess performance gains.

## Testing

Ensuring the reliability and correctness of each snippet is paramount. The `test_all.py` file contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering various scenarios and edge cases for each bitwise operation.

**Running Tests**:
```bash
cd Bitwise
python test_all.py
```

**Test Coverage**:
- **Positive Cases**: Valid inputs producing expected outputs.
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions such as zero, negative numbers, and maximum integer sizes.
- **Invalid Inputs**: Handling of incorrect data types and out-of-range values.

**Example Test Case**:
```python
def test_flip_bit(self):
    self.assertEqual(flip_bit(5, 0), 4)  # 5 is 101, flipping LSB gives 100 (4)
    self.assertEqual(flip_bit(5, 2), 1)  # 5 is 101, flipping bit at position 2 gives 001 (1)
```
