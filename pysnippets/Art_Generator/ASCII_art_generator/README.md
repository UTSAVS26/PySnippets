# ASCII Art Generator

## Overview
This Python script converts an image into an ASCII art representation using different characters based on the brightness of each pixel. The script uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle image processing, and it resizes the image while maintaining the aspect ratio.

## Features
- Converts images into grayscale.
- Maps pixel brightness to ASCII characters.
- Resizes images to a specified width while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- Outputs ASCII art directly to the console.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install the following Python library:

```bash
pip install pillow
